=Hazard Class:=

_Class 1(save|green/blue)_
its dangerous if you trip over your own feet

_Class 2_(okay*ish|yellow)
like earth, generally save but there is shit that can kill you
(think lions, diseases, your mom after you wrecked her car)

Class 3(high danger|red)
everybody is trying to kill you all the time

Class 4(nope|black)
the air is trying to kill you, every second you are here is a second where you could die

Class 5(Quarantined|?|purple?)
Locked down. Coming out of it could destroy your reality(universal hazard).kinda like a virus thingy you go in: you die and everybody else does too | you go out: you die and everybody else does too




=Scale:=

_Infinite_
infinite amount of energy, matter, space, sushi

_Finite_
the universe has a finite amount of matter and energy etc.

_Something else_
could be constantly changing/ trippy stuff




=Dimensional Structure of universe:=

_Layered_
reality consists of stacked layers serparated by boundaries

_Bubble_
reality exists as selfisolated bubble (interaction with other reaitys is only possible within the bubble)

_Interwoven_
realitys constantly influence and interact with each other (basically quantum entaglement)




=Causality:=

_Isolated_
no interaction at all | action =X=> reaction

_Leaking_
Energy and matter can travel between universes but rareley does on its own

_Interactive_
universes can activley interact with each other and do so by constantly merging/diverging(broken reality type shit)

_Branching_
each decision/interaction etc. creates a new universe (fractral universe theory)




=Physical Laws:=

_Uniform_
the universe conforms to the base laws of physics (gravity etc. (a lot of universes do))

_Variant_
the universe does some weird shit that other universes dont (laws are still static)

_Evolving_
physical and natural laws change and evolve over time, sometimes even as cause of an interaction 




=Origin of the Universe:=

_Silmutanious_
emerged with everything else(always was there basically)

_Sequencial_
universe got created due to an event or decision (could be part of an fractral universe)

_Pulsating/Cyclic_
collapses and getts reborn again and again and again

_Engineered_
universe was artificially created by gods or higly advanced civilisations or some other schizo shit
